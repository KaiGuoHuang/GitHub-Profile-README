<h2>About ðŸš€ðŸ’¯MLProjects</h2>

__100MLProjects__ is a challenge that I created for myself to get proficient in Machine Learning and Deep Learning by building 100 Projects within increasing complexity over a period of two years.

I document my experience throughout this process, and you can find them on my [Medium Blog](https://laxmena.medium.com).
